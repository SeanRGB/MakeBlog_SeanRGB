tl;dr: My blog is a jumble of things I care about and obsess over. A few you'll encounter are: innovative data science projects, improving education and making it easier for people to learn, and making our minds better by learning techniques from Stoicism and Buddhism.

## Here are some things that I spend a lot of time thinking about

### Data Science for improving the way people live

Most of this blog will be about data science. I love doing data science projects in Python, but I don't like the idea that I'm not really documenting what I work on or how far I get. I'll remedy that with this blog. Expect Python, expect Juptyer notebooks, expect pretty figures and plots of things that you probably don't care about.

### Education, learning how to be better at learning
Modern cognitive science studies into how people learn and retain information blow my mind. I recently went through the video lectures for [Learning How to Learn on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) by the lovely and brilliant Barbara Oakley (Terrence Sejnowski was there too). I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be better at learning new things. It's especially useful if you're in a fast-changing field like Data Science, and you are force learning new things every day.

I'm also passionate about better learning methods because  how it applies to teaching. I wish I had taken Barbara Oakley's course before I entered High School. Instead I made my way through a physics undergrad program and through most of grad school without ever having learned proper study habits. While I was going through these educational institutions, it was also clear that my professors knew nothing about how the human brain best learns. We were force-fed content in lectures without having first developing proper mental models of the subject; which would have added important context to what we were learning and why. We were tested in a high-cost, low-feedback setting, with exams that would significantly impact our grades if we did things wrong, but with little opportunity before-hand to learn if we were doing things wrong. It was very much an environment where we had a <i>safe on the stage</i> and not a <i>guide on the side</i>. So I think this a lot, and will probably write about it a lot as I discover new things that work for me.

### How to live well; How to think better.

This is why I'm obsessed with ancient Roman Stoicism. It's about building for yourself the best mental operating system for living in a chaotic world. I've also found important aspects of things in reading about Buddhism and trying Buddhist-style meditation through the Headspace app.
